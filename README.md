# cs4320exercise7.1 testing assignment

The submitted pytest files for this assignment are the 15 files in the "exercises" folder that start with "test_". To run the tests, navigate to the exercises directory and type "pytest (filename).py" in the terminal or wherever you are supposed to type it. I'm not really sure how this works.
